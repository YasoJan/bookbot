## Goals 🎯

- **Count Total Words In Text File** 📝

  - Utilizes a method to iterate through text, excluding whitespaces, to maintain an accurate word count. 🔍
  
- **Count Total Instances of Letters In Text File** 🅰️

  - Employs the `isalpha` method to filter and tally only alphabetic characters within a text, storing the results in a dictionary. 📊

- **Generate a Detailed Report** 📈

  - Constructs a report using a list of dictionaries, each containing two keyed elements to organize and present data effectively. 📝

  - Implements a `sort_on` helper function to isolate the numerical count for each entry. 🔢
  
  - This helper function is subsequently employed as the sorting criterion in the `sort()` method, ensuring data is presented in an ordered fashion. ↗️
