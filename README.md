## Goals 🎯

- **Count Total Words In Text File** 📝

  - Creates a function to iterate through text, excluding whitespaces, to maintain a cummulative word count. 🔍
  
- **Count Total Instances of Letters In Text File** 

  - Uses the `isalpha` method to filter out and count only alphabetic characters within a text, storing the information in a dictionary. 📊

- **Generate a Detailed Report** 📈

  - Constructs a report using a list of dictionaries, each containing two keyed elements to organize the data effectively. 📝

  - Implements a `sort_on` helper function to only isolate the numerical count for each entry. 🔢
  
  - This helper function is then employed as the sorting criterion in 'key' within the `sort()` method, which preserves the data in an ordered fashion. ↗️
